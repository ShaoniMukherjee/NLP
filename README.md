# NLP
Lexical processing: In this stage, you will be required to do text preprocessing and text cleaning
steps such as tokenisation, stemming, lemmatization, correcting spellings, etc.
2. Syntactic processing: In this step, you will be required to extract more meaning from the sentence,
by using its syntax this time. Instead of just blindly looking at what the words are, youâ€™ll look at the
syntactic structures, i.e., the grammar of the language to understand what the meaning is.
3. Semantic processing: Lexical and syntactic processing do not suffice when it comes to building
advanced NLP applications such as language translation, chatbots etc. The machine, after the two
steps given above, will still be incapable of understanding the meaning of each word. Here, you will
try and extract the hidden meaning behind the words which is also the most difficult part for
computers. Semantic processing helps you to build advanced applications such as chatbots and
language translators.
